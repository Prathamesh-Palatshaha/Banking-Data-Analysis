# üè¶ Banking Data Dashboard with Power BI

This project showcases a complete workflow for building a banking data dashboard using **Power BI**, with the backend work done using **Python** and **MySQL**. It reflects my journey of learning data analysis from database integration to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visual storytelling using Power BI.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze banking data, understand customer behavior and trends, and finally build a compelling dashboard using Power BI for actionable insights. I focused on learning and applying key concepts of data ingestion, processing, and visualization.

## üß† What I Learned

### ‚úÖ 1. Importing CSV/Excel to MySQL
- Understood how to clean and structure raw banking data.
- Imported the data into a **MySQL database** using tools like MySQL Workbench and command-line interface.

### ‚úÖ 2. Fetching Data using Python
- Used `mysql-connector-python` to connect Python to the MySQL database.
- Queried the data directly and converted it to **Pandas DataFrames** for analysis.

### ‚úÖ 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed EDA using Python libraries like:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- Identified key metrics and dimensions to include in the dashboard (e.g. customer demographics, transaction volumes, loan status).

### ‚úÖ 4. Building Dashboard in Power BI
- Imported the cleaned and analyzed dataset into **Power BI**.
- Designed a dashboard with interactive filters, KPI cards, and visual charts for better decision-making.
